## Installation

Use pip to install MockSign with

```bash
pip install mocksign
```

## Usage

Before using MockSign, a collection of real signature images is needed. This can be
achieved by scanning and cropping signatures using an image editing program like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and saving them into a designated folder.

Afterwards, MockSign can be started with `mocksign`.
