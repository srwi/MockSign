# FalsiSignPy

Simulate the look of hand signed and scanned documents. FalsiSignPy is inspired
by [FalsiSign](https://gitlab.com/edouardklein/falsisign) by Edouard Klein.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install FalsiSignPy.

```bash
pip install FalsiSignPy
```

## Usage

Before using FalsiSignPy, a collection of real signature images is needed. This can be
done by scanning and cropping signatures and saving them into a folder.

Afterwards, FalsiSignPy can be started with `falsisignpy`.
